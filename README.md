# Seven Staged Identity Recognition System Using Kinect V2 Sensor

This repository presents the **Seven Staged Identity Recognition System Using Kinect V2 Sensor**, which implements a robust, multi-stage identity recognition framework. The system leverages color and depth image processing, signal processing, machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms for high-accuracy recognition in various security applications.

## üìú **Motivation**
Most existing identity recognition systems operate in only three stages, which may lead to security vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a more robust seven-stage system to achieve nearly **99% accuracy** by combining cutting-edge technologies with a Kinect V2 sensor and additional hardware enhancements like macro lenses.

## üõ†Ô∏è **System Architecture**
The proposed system consists of **seven recognition and estimation stages**:
1. **Face Recognition**
2. **Voice Recognition**
3. **Fingerprint Recognition**
4. **Iris Recognition**
5. **Gesture Recognition**
6. **Sex Detection**
7. **Age Estimation**

Each stage utilizes a combination of **machine learning algorithms**, **fuzzy systems**, and advanced image and signal processing techniques to improve accuracy and reliability.

## üöÄ **Methodology**

### **1. Data Acquisition**
The Kinect V2 sensor captures both **color** and **depth data**, enabling robust recognition even in challenging environments, such as pure darkness (via infrared support).

### **2. Preprocessing**
- **Image Data**:
  - **Face and Iris Recognition**: Background removal using the Viola-Jones algorithm, edge detection with Canny, and morphological operations.
  - **Gesture Recognition**: Body segmentation from depth data.
  - **Fingerprint Recognition**: Captured using the color sensor and enhanced by a macro lens.
- **Audio Data**:
  - Noise removal and normalization using a median filter.
  - Feature extraction via **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**.

### **3. Feature Extraction**
- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** for images.
- **MFCCs** for voice data.
- **Local Phase Quantization (LPQ)** and **Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF)** for age and sex estimation.
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for fingerprint and iris recognition.

### **4. Dimensionality Reduction**
- Features are refined using **Lasso regularization**, which removes outliers and accelerates classification.

### **5. Classification**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for face, voice, iris, and fingerprint classification.
- **Differential Evolution Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (DE-ANFIS)** for gesture and sex classification.

### **6. Decision Integration**
- After all stages are processed, the system checks for consistency in the recognition results.
- If all stages match, the identity is confirmed and the system halts with success; otherwise, it loops back for re-identification.

- **CNN**: 99.41%
- **SVM**: 98.50%
- **DE-ANFIS**: 97.91%

#### **Confusion Matrices**:
Detailed confusion matrices for each classification stage demonstrate the system's robustness and minimal misclassifications.
